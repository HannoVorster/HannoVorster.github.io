For a long time Windows did not support SSH. Linux and MAc users can easily open up their Terminal and type ssh and then they can SSH into a device.

Powershell was first released back in November 2006, and over the years it grew more powerfull.

Now on this date of publish you can easily use Powershell to SSH into a device without needing to download Putty.

I am using Powershell core, so yours migh be blue, but all-in-all both are the same.

To SSH into a device is very easy. Simply type ssh followed by your device username and IP address.

After pressing enter, SSH asks for my Raspberry Pi user password, after entering it I am logged into my Raspberry Pi without Putty!

Hooray!!

This is one of the great wonders of Powershell and there are a lot more!
